<h1>The Bodhi Guide to Enlightenment<br>
Virtual Desktops</h1>

<hr>

<p><strong>Virtual Desktops</strong> (sometimes called "workspaces") are utilized in nearly all Window Managers (at least those for Linux/Unix systems). <strong>Virtual Desktops</strong> allow you to keep your work organized with the ability to have different programs running on different desktops.


<p>This may seem like an unusual and unnecessary feature at first, but rest assured that once you get in the habit of using them it is very hard to go back to using just a single desktop. 

<h2>Switching Virtual Desktops</h2>

<p><strong>Enlightenment (E17)</strong> provides both a graphical representation of your <strong>Virtual Desktops</strong> (the <strong>Pager <a href="gadgets.html"></strong>Gadget</a>) and a keyboard shortcut to navigate among them.

<p>Even with no <strong>Pager</strong> installed or running, the key combination <em>CTRL+ALT+[right arrow]</em> will move you to the workspace to the right, and <em>CTRL+ALT+[left arrow]</em> will move you back one workspace to the left.



<h2>Seeing your Virtual Desktops</h2>

<p>For a graphical, clickable representation of your multiple workspaces, Enlightenment provides the <strong>Pager</strong> Gadget.

<p>Depending on which <a href="profiles.html">Profile</a> you selected (during the <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> installation), the <strong>Pager</strong> will appear in different ways: different number of rows and columns of <b>thumbnail</b> representations of the desktops, and either on the desktop or on a <a href=shelves.html>Shelf</a>.


<p>Here is a screenshot of the <strong>Pager</strong> on the desktop in the "Fancy" Profile: <br><br>

<img src="../images/pager_desktop.png">

<p>And this is how the <strong>Pager</strong> appears in a <strong>Shelf</strong> in the "Laptop" Profile.<br><br>

<img src="../images/pager_shelf.png">

<p>You can switch from any <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> to any other simply by clicking on its <em>thumbnail.</em>

<p>In each screenshot, notice how each <em>thumbnail</em> that is second from the (top) left has an blue moonlit image in it. That is the image that is set as the desktop background, and the fact that it appears in only the one <em>thumbnail</em> indicates that this is the currently active desktop.

<p>Also notice that the (top) left <em>thumbnail</em> in both screenshots has 2 grey boxes. These are graphics representing the open applications on that desktop, in this case <strong>LXTerminal</strong> and <strong>Leafpad</strong>.



<h2>Virtual Desktop Settings</h2>

<p>As with almost everything in <strong>E17</strong>, you are not stuck with the <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> setup that appeared at installation. In the "Fancy" <strong>Profile</strong> illustrated above, the <strong>Pager</strong> has four columns and three rows, which may be too many for some users. The "Laptop" <strong>Profile</strong>
had only a single row, which is appropriate if you want to keep your <strong>Pager</strong> on a </strong>Shelf</strong> - but there's nothing stopping you from having two rows in your <strong>Pager</strong> on that, or any other <strong>Shelf</strong>!


<p>To change the layout and appearance use the <strong>Virtual Desktops Settings</strong> dialog. This can be accessed in two ways:<br><br> 
1) <em>right-click</em> on the <strong>Pager</strong> and select <em>Virtual Desktop Settings </em><br><br>
2) <em>Main Menu -> Settings -> All -> Screen -> Virtual Desktops.</em>

<img src="../images/virtual_desktops.png"> 

<p>In the <strong>Virtual Desktops Settings</strong> window that appears, you can adjust the number of rows and columns with the <em>vertical</em> and <em>horizontal sliders</em> respectively.

<p>Below this are two checkboxes:<br><br>
<em>Flip when dragging objects to the screen edge</em> is currently disabled and has no effect whether checked or not.<br><br>

<em>Wrap desktops around when flipping</em> controls whether the system will switch back to the first desktop after reaching the last, or vice-versa. 

<p>Click on any of the desktops and a <em>Desk Settings</em> window will pop up. In this window, not only can you change the name of the <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong>, but you can also choose any picture on your disk for this particular <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> by clicking on the <em>Set</em> button. In the <em>Wallpaper Settings</em> window that pops up, you can click on the <em>Picture</em> button to open the <em>Select a Picture...</em> dialogue.<br>

<p>Navigate to the folder with your background picture for this <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong>, select it and click the <em>OK</em> button. Repeat this sequence for all of your <strong>Virtual Desktops</strong> if you want alternate wallpapers per desktop.


<h2>Moving Applications Between Desktops</h2>

<p>In another display of <strong>E17</strong>'s versatility there is more than one way to move an application to a <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> other than the one where it is currently running.


<p>The first is to <em>right-click</em> anywhere on the title bar of the window you would like to move, scroll down to <em>Move To</em> and select the desktop you would like to move it to. The default naming scheme for desktops is as follows: <code>Desktop [row],[column]</code> and both rows and columns begin numbering at 0.

<p>The second method is to <em>left-click</em> and <em>drag</em> the small icon in the top left of the window, then <em>drag-and-drop</em> it on the <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> <em>thumbnail</em> in the <strong>Pager</strong> you want to move it to. If you find you've moved a window to another <strong>Virtual Desktop</strong> and it is in a position that is partially off the screen to where you can't grab the title bar to reposition the window, there is a simple fix: just hold down the <em>Alt</em> key then <em>click and hold</em> anywhere on the visible part of the window. You can then drag the window to where you would like it
