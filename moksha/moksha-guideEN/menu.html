        <h1> Complete Guide to Bodhi Linux: "Main Menu"</h1>
        <hr /> Computer users have become accustomed to having a "main menu" <b>("Menu")</b>
        since the release of Windows 95. Since then, Windows has stayed
        consistent, putting a "Start Menu" on the bottom left hand corner of the
        screen - accessible via mouse click or keyboard shortcut. Apple
        introduced a similar feature with the "Apple Menu" which is located on
        the top left corner of the screen. Bodhi Linux keeps with the tradition
        and by default has a "Main Menu" button located on the bottom left
        corner of the screen.

        <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Moksha</strong> provides the Menu through the use of a <strong>Start
            <a href="gadgets.html"></a></strong><a href="gadgets.html">Gadget</a>
          which is typically placed on a <a href="shelves.html">Shelf</a> but
          can also be placed directly on the desktop. Bodhi's default theme
          comes with the Gadget placed on the bottom left corner and looks like
          three dots. </p>
        <center><img src="../images/defaultMenu.png" alt="Bodhi Start Default Start Menu"
            width="200" height="110" /></center>
        <p>Most, but not all, of the <a href="profiles.html">Profiles</a>
          installed with <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>Menu and in most of the <a
            href="themes.html">Themes</a> the placement of the <em>Menu</em> is
          on the bottom left corner on a shelf. Additionally, in most <a href="themes.html">Themes</a>
          the <em>Menu</em> looks like the <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> leaf
          logo. </p>
        <p>Because Bodhi Linux is built on the principles of choice, the Gadget
          can be placed on the desktop itself (i.e., not stuck on a Shelf at
          all) or, a user can opt to not have a start Gadget at all. </p>
        <p>However, it is possible to remove the <strong>Start</strong> button.
          This may seem an odd thing to do to people unfamiliar with <strong>Moksha</strong>.
          But fear not, this does not remove the menu, merely its button. <strong>Moksha</strong>'s
          menus can be displayed by clicking on any unoccupied spot on the
          desktop. Note that <strong>Moksha</strong> has two menus. The <strong>Menu</strong>
          found by clicking a <strong>Start</strong> button or left clicking
          any blank spot on <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>'s desktop is known as
          the <strong>Main Menu</strong>. Whereas, the menu displayed by right
          clicking on an unoccupied spot on the desktop is the <a href="#Favorite%20Applications">Favorites
            Menu</a>. On a default installation of <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>,
          the <strong>Favorites Menu</strong> is empty but as we shall see it
          is easy to add your own favorite applications to this menu. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/shortcut-menu-key.png" align="right" />In
          addition to accessing <strong>Moksha's Main Menu</strong> from either
          the <strong>Start</strong> button or from the left-click on the
          desktop, in <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> there is a default <a href="key_bindings.html">key-binding</a>
          to open the <strong>Main Menu</strong> from the keyboard. It's the
          Menu key! On most keyboards this key is to the right of the spacebar
          near the <em>Alt</em> and <em>Ctrl</em> keys and looks like the
          image to the right. Naturally this keyboard shortcut can be changed by
          the user or deleted altogether. </p>
        <h2><a name="Where Did It Go?">Where Did it Go?</a></h2>
        <p>A minor digression on using <strong>Moksha's Menu</strong> that may
          confuse some new users of <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>. As you scroll
          down the <strong>Main Menu</strong> list, the sub-menu entries always
          open to the right of the menu. Ordinarily this is not a problem, but
          what if you open the <strong>Main Menu</strong> close to right edge
          of the screen? In that case the sub-menu may open and be partially or
          totally offscreen. It appears to be a quirk with<strong> Moksha's</strong>
          menu implementation, but that thought is a bit hasty. In this case you
          merely have to move the mouse cursor to the right and the whole menu
          structure moves to left revealing the hidden sub-menu items. As
          programmers are fond of saying, ”It is not a bug, it is a feature.”
          Another example of the elegance and beauty of <strong>Moksha</strong>.

        <h2><a name="Menu Structure">Menu Structure</a></h2>
        <p>This section is a brief description of the structure of <strong>Bodhi
            Linux's Main Menu</strong>, although truthfully the best way to gain
          familiarity with the menu is to open it up and explore it. But
          nonetheless, the <strong>Main Menu</strong> in a default installation
          of <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> lists, from top to bottom:<br />
          <img src="../images/bodhi_menu.png" align="right" /> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h6>Applications</h6>
            Contains most of the GUI applications installed on your system,
            arranged in sub menus based upon categories. Command line
            Applications will not be displayed in the Applications Menu. They
            can, however, be added.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6>Places</h6>
            In a default installation of <strong>Bodhi Linux, Places</strong>
            allows you to open the Home folder, the Trash folder, and the (root)
            File system as well as mounted file systems and the default file
            manager's Bookmarks. <strong>Places</strong> is actually a <a href="modules.html">Module</a>
            and can be unloaded in which case it will disappear from the menu.
            You can also change the default settings of the <strong>Places
              Module</strong>. To do so from the <strong>Main Menu</strong> go
            to <em>Settings → All → Files → Places</em>. This will open a <strong>Places
              Settings</strong> dialog window where you can adjust Places to
            display or not to display the following: Home, Desktop, Trash, File
            system, Temp, and Favorites. You also have an option to not to
            display Places altogether in the <strong>Main Menu</strong>.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6>Quick Launcher</h6>
            Launches the Quick Launcher Application.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6>Take Screen Shot</h6>
            As the name suggests, this launches the screen shot application.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>About operating System</h6>
            Here you will find <strong></strong><strong></strong> four
            sections:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><h7>Help</h7><br />
              Opens the the Bodhi <a href="http://www.bodhilinux.com/quickstart/quickstartEN/">Quick

            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <h6>Settings</h6>
            Opens <strong>Moksha's Settings Panel.</strong> A tweakers
            paradise!</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6>System</h6>
            Here are the familiar Shutdown, Reboot, Suspend, Lock, et. al.
            functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It should be further noted that loading certain <strong>Modules</strong>
          or changing some of <strong>Moksha's Settings</strong> may add or
          remove some menu items. Furthermore, adding applications to the <strong>Favorites
            Menu</strong> will add <strong>Favorite Applications</strong> to
          the top of the <strong>Main Menu</strong> list, which brings us to
          our next topic. </p>
        <h2><a name="Favorite Applications">Favorite Applications</a></h2>
        <p>The <strong>Favorites Menu</strong> contains a list of applications
          to which the user wishes quick access. This list of favorite
          applications can be found in either <strong>Bodhi Linux's Main Menu</strong>
          or by right clicking any unoccupied spot on the desktop. On a default
          installation of <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>, the <strong>Favorites
            Menu</strong> will not show up in <strong>Bodhi Linux's Main Menu</strong>
          nor will the right-click to access the <strong>Favorites Menu</strong>
          work. This is because no applications have been added to the favorites
          list by default. It is the philosophy of <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>
          not to try to second guess what the user wants and to keep things
          minimal and let the users decide what they want themselves. </p>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <img src="../images/fav00.png" align="right" />
        <h3>Adding Terminology to Favorites</h3>
        <p>There are two methods of adding an application to the <strong>Favorites
            Menu</strong>. For the first method, launch the application you wish
          to add, say Terminology. Left click the application's icon in the
          upper left hand corner choose the app's name and then click <em>Add
            to Favorites Menu</em> as pictured to the right. Teminology will now
          appear in your <strong>Favorites Menu</strong>. Incredibly simple and
          truly elegant! <br />
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <img src="../images/fav02.png" align="left" />
        <p>The second method is not much more difficult. From <strong>Bodhi
            Linux's Main Menu</strong>, Choose <em>Settings → All → Apps →
            Favorite Applications</em>. This launches <strong>Moksha's Favorite
            Applications</strong> window, under <em>Applications</em> scroll
          down the list until you find the application you wish to add, click it
          to highlight it and then click the <em>Add</em> button. A green dot
          will appear beside the applications name as pictured to the left for
          PCManFM. (<strong>Note:</strong> the indicator may be something other
          than a green dot in some <strong>Profiles</strong>) Click <em>Apply</em>
          and then <em>Ok</em>. The application will now be added to your <strong>Favorites</strong>
          list and appear in the menu.<br />
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <img src="../images/fav03.png" align="right" />
        <p>To remove an application from the <strong>Favorites Menu</strong>,
          launch the <strong>Favorite Applications</strong> window as was done
          above. Scroll through the application list, noting that applications
          in the <strong>Favorites Menu</strong> will have a green dot (or
          other indicator) by their name. Find the application you wish to
          remove, click it to highlight it and then click the <em>Remove</em>
          button. The green dot (or other indicator) beside the application's
          name will disappear. Now click <em>Apply</em> and then <em>Ok</em>.
          The applications will now be removed from your <strong>Favorites Menu</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>If you are an avid user of the <strong>Favorites Menu</strong> and
          frequently use a lot of applications, you may find your Favorites Menu
          becomes rather long and you may desire a different order, perhaps
          placing the apps you access most often at the top of the list.
          Naturally <strong>E17</strong> provides a means to change the order
          of the applications in the list. Again launch <strong>E17's Favorite
            Applications</strong>, only this time click on the <em>Order</em>
          tab, as pictured to the right. Find the application you wish to move,
          click it to highlight it. Now click either the <em>Up</em> or <em>Down</em>
          buttons to position it where you wish it to be in the menu. If desired
          you can do the same for one or more other applications. Once the order
          desired is created, click <em>Apply</em> and then <em>Ok</em>.<br />
        </p>

        <h2><a name="Customizing Bodhi Linux's Menu">Customizing Bodhi Linux's
            Menu</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Moksha</strong> has a rather unique approach to task of
          editing, adding or removing menu items. Instead of offering a separate
          application allowing the user to change menu items, the ability to
          graphically edit a menu item is incorporated into <strong>Moksha</strong>
          itself. To see how let's examine how to add an application to the <strong>Main
            Menu</strong>. </p>
        <h2><a name="Adding an Application">Adding an Application</a></h2>
        <p>Sometimes you install an application and it does not appear in the
          menu, this is probably the result of how the application was packaged.
          The two procedures outlined below for adding these two applications
          should apply to any application you install but for whatever reason
          does not install a <strong>Main Menu</strong> application entry. </p>
        <p> The key here is to launch the application. There are two or more
          different ways you could do this. One is to use <strong>Moksha's
            Quick launcher,</strong> another is to launch the app from a
          terminal. </p>
        <p>To illustrate using the <strong>Quick launcher</strong> application,
          first let us launch <strong><a href="everything.html">Quick Launcher</a></strong>
          It can be found in the <strong>Main Menu</strong> or launched by a
          key board shortcut, <em>Alt-Esc, Ctrl-Alt-Space</em> or <em>Windows-Space</em>.
          Once it launches start typing Archive Manager and as soon as it is
          displayed double click the icon to launch it. </p>
        <center><img src="../images/everything_ar.png" /></center>
        <p>Once the application launches, right-click application's Title bar or
          its icon in the window's upper left-hand corner and choose <em>Application
            Name → Edit Icon</em>. A <strong>Desktop Entry Editor</strong>
          window will pop up as pictured below, click on <em>Options</em> and
          then check <em>Show In Menus</em> and then click <em>Apply</em> and
          <em>Close</em>. Now your application will be in the menu under
          Accessories. </p>
        <center><img src="../images/desktopentry0.png" /></center>
        <p>Now for the second method. This method is merely an alternative way
          to launch the <strong>Desktop Entry Editor</strong> window. In the <strong>Main
            Menu</strong> choose <em>Settings → All → Apps → Create Launcher</em>.
          In the <strong>Desktop Entry Editor</strong> window which pops up
          fill in the following entries: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h6><em>The Basic Tab</em></h6>
            Name: Terminology<br />
            Comment: Use the command line<br />
            Application: Terminology</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6><em>The Icon Tab</em></h6>
            Icon: terminology</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6><em>The General Tab</em></h6>
            Generic name: Terminal Categories: ;Utility;TerminalEmulator;</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <h6><em>The Options Tab</em></h6>
            Check Show in Menus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When completed, click Apply and Close. Now <strong>Terminology</strong>
          will be in the menu under Accessories. </p>
        <h2><a name="Removing an Application">Removing an Application</a></h2>
        <p>Now that you have seen how to use the <strong>Desktop Entry Editor</strong>
          it should be obvious how you remove an entry from the menu. Launch the
          application you wish to remove and then left click its icon in the
          windows upper left hand corner and choose <em>Application name → Edit
            Icon</em>. A <strong>Desktop Entry Editor</strong> window will pop
          up, click on <em>Options</em> and then uncheck <em>Show In Menus</em>
          and then click <em>Apply</em> and <em>Close</em>. Where naturally,
          application name is the name of the application you wish to remove and
          the very first menu entry in the ”left click on the icon” context
          menu. </p>
