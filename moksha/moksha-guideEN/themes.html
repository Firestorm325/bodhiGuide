<h1>The Bodhi Guide to Moksha<br>
Themes</h1>

<p><strong>Moksha</strong> gives the user a lot of 
control when it comes to configuring their desktop. It is quite common for <strong>Moksha</strong> users to spend hours
tweaking different settings to get it just right. Some of these
users have been kind enough to share their hard work by creating <strong>Themes</strong>.


<p><strong>Themes</strong> provide a way to package together all the different
options that alter the look of your desktop. This can include 
everything from the background to the <strong>Clock</strong> <a href="gadgets.html">Gadget</a>.

<p>To bring up the<strong> Theme Selector</strong> dialog go to<em> Main Menu -> Settings -> Settings Panel -> Look -> Theme</em>.
 (If you do not see this option, you may need to <em>load</em> the <strong> Theme</strong> <a href="modules.html">Module</a>)
 
 

<p>This is the Basic view of the <strong>Theme Selector</strong>.

<center><img src="../images/e17-guide-themes-basic-view.png"></center>

<p>The list on the left shows all the available <strong>Themes</strong>. Clicking on one will show a preview of the <strong>Theme</strong> background on the right. When you find a <strong>Theme</strong> you like, select it from the list and click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em>. The changes will usually take place immediately. If they don't, try restarting <strong>Moksha</strong> (<em>Main Menu -> About Operating System -> Reset Moksha</em>).


<p>You might be wondering what the options <em>Personal</em> and <em>System</em> in the top left of the dialog mean. This simply indicates in what directory the <strong>Theme Selector </strong>is looking for <strong>Themes</strong>. The <em>System</em> option tells it to look in <code>/usr/share/enlightenment/data/themes/</code>. The <em>Personal</em> option points to <code>~/.e/e/themes/</code>. If you are the creative type and want to create your own <strong>Theme</strong>, you can save it here (See <a href="creating_themes.html"><strong> Creating Themes</strong></a>). Also, please consider sharing it with the rest
of the <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> community.


<h2><a name="Adding Themes">Adding Themes</a></h2>

<p>By default, <strong>Bodhi</strong> only comes with a handful of <strong>Themes</strong>. You can download more from <a href="http://www.bodhilinux.com/softwaregroup/themes"> Bodhi's Themes Collection</a> (external link). Click on the name of a theme to display it, then press the <em>Install</em> button. For further information on how to install new themes, see <a href="www.bodhilinux.com/changing-enlightenment-themes">Changing Moksha Themes</a> (external link).


<p>Once installed, your new <strong>Themes</strong> should show under the <em>System</em> <strong>Theme</strong> options.

<h2><a name="Advanced Themes">Advanced Themes</a></h2>

<p>By now, you probably have tried out several different <strong>Themes</strong>. It's likely that you have found things to like and dislike about several of them, and perhaps you wish you could use the <strong>Menu</strong> from one <strong>Theme</strong> along with the <strong>Clock</strong> style of another. As mentioned before, the user is in control of their desktop, and the <strong>Theme Selector</strong> makes it very easy to mix and match different elements from different <strong>Themes</strong>.


<p>Open the <strong>Theme Selector</strong> and click on the <em>Advanced</em> button in
the bottom right corner. The dialog will expand into three sections.

<center><img src="../images/e17-guide-themes-advanced-view.png" width="650"></center>

<p>The first section on the left, <strong>Theme Categories</strong>, shows all the different options that can be controlled by <strong>Themes</strong>. The middle section, <strong>Themes</strong>, shows all the available <strong>Themes</strong> on your computer. The right most section, <strong>Preview</strong>, is a preview window like the one in the Basic view.


<p>In <strong>Theme Categories</strong>, all the options with a <em>check</em> next to them have an assigned <strong>Theme</strong>. In the <strong>Themes</strong> section, all <strong>Themes</strong> with the <em>paintbrush and colors icon</em> are <strong>Themes</strong> that have been assigned to at least one category.


<h3><a name="Assigning Themes">Assign Themes</a></h3>

<p>To assign a theme to a category, select the category in the <strong>Theme Categories</strong> section. Then select the desired <strong>Theme</strong> from the <strong>Themes</strong> section, and click the <em>Assign</em> button near the bottom left corner.

<p>For example, say you like most of the <em>Sky-Bodhi</em> <strong>Theme</strong>, except you would prefer to use the <strong>Start</strong> button from <em>Grayish-Bodhi</em>. Open the Advanced <strong>Theme Selector</strong> dialog, select the <em>modules/start</em> category under <strong>Theme Categories</strong>, select the <em>AL-Grayish-Bodhi</em> theme under <strong>Themes</strong>, and click <em>Assign</em>. You will notice that an icon displays
next to the newly assigned category. This indicates the category's <strong>Theme</strong> has been changed. Changes will not take effect until you click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> at the bottom of the dialog. You can make assignments to as many categories as you want, and when you are ready, <em>Apply</em> all the changes at once. Using our example, if you go back and look at the <em>modules/start</em> category you should see a <em>check</em> next to it indicating that this category is assigned a <strong>Theme</strong>. Selecting the category will show you what <strong>Theme</strong> is assigned by automatically selecting it in the <strong>Themes</strong> section.


<h3><a name="Removing Themes">Remove Themes</a></h3>

<p>If you want to remove an assigned <strong>Theme</strong> from a category, select the category and click <em>Clear</em>. Alternatively, you can remove all <strong>Themes</strong> by clicking <em>Clear All</em>. Then click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> to remove the assignment.


<h3><a name="Base Theme">Base Theme</a></h3>

<p>One special category of note is the <em>Base Theme</em> category. If a <strong>Theme</strong> is assigned to <em>Base Theme</em>, it will apply to all categories defined in the <strong>Theme</strong>.The Basic view of the <strong>Theme Selector</strong> is actually a streamlined interface for assigning this category.  


<p>No <em>check marks</em> will show next to affected categories to indicate they are customized, as the result of assigning the <em>Base Theme</em>. This is because assigning a <strong>Theme</strong> to any of the other categories will override any customizations from the <em>Base Theme</em>. 

<p>Any category without a <strong>Theme</strong> assigned (either directly assigned or 
from the <em>Base Theme</em>) will use the <em>default</em> theme. 


<h3><a name="Saving Themes">Saving Themes</a></h3>

<p>Now perhaps, you have spent several hours creating a custom <strong>Theme</strong>
by mixing up themes from the Advanced <strong>Theme Selector</strong>. You want
to try a new look, but not lose your current <strong>Theme</strong>. At this point,
you are probably looking for the <em>Save</em> button, but you won't find it
because it does not exist. To get around this, we can use <strong>Profiles</strong>. (Further information in the <a href="profiles.html">Profiles section.</a>)


<p>During your first boot of <strong>Bodhi</strong>, you may have been asked to select a <strong>Profile</strong> (Bare,
Desktop, Fancy, etc.). Or you may have been assigned a default profile. All the changes you have made to your current
theme are now a part of that <strong>Profile</strong>.

<p>To open the <strong>Profile</strong> dialog, go to <em>Main Menu -> Settings -> Settings Panel -> Settings -> Profiles</em>.
This will open the <strong>Profile Selector</strong>.


<center><img src="../images/e17-guide-themes-profiles.png"></center>

<p>Your current <strong>Profile</strong> will be selected. Click the <em>Add</em> button
at the bottom, and enter a name into the <strong>Add New Profile</strong> dialog
that pops up. Click <em>OK</em>, and your new <strong>Profile</strong> will be added 
to the list of available profiles. Your new <strong>Profile</strong> is initially
a duplicate of your current <strong>Profile</strong>.


<p>Select the new <strong>Profile</strong> and click <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em>. <strong>E17</strong> will
restart, and you will see the same desktop that you saw before (this
is expected because it is a duplicate of your other <strong>Profile</strong>).
Now make some changes to your theme and/or layout of your desktop.
Go back to the <strong>Profile Selector</strong>, and change back to your old <strong>Profile</strong>. You should see your previous <strong>Theme</strong> and layout.


<h3><a name="Creating Themes">Creating Themes</a></h3>

<p>The above method of using <strong>Profiles</strong> is a quick hack and not the
most elegant way to save a <strong>Theme</strong>. The ideal method should be
to create an actual <strong>Theme</strong>. This topic is beyond the scope of this
section. Check out <a href="creating_themes.html">Creating Themes</a> sections for instruction on how to do this.

<h2><a name="Changing Just the Background">Change Just the Background</a></h2>

<p>If you're interested in changing just the background (wallpaper), here's how. Go to <em>Main Menu -> Settings -> Settings Panel -> Look -> Wallpaper</em>. Uncheck the <em>Use Theme Wallpaper</em> option, and select the background you want. You may need to import the picture if you do not see it initially. Use the <em>Picture</em> dialog to do this.

<h2><a name="Other Theme Considerations">Other Theme Considerations</a></h2>
This article has discussed how to customize your <strong>Moksha Theme</strong> and various elements within it. However, many applications in use on Linux systems are built using either the <strong>GTK</strong> or the <strong>QT</strong> toolkit and therefore will not be affected by changes to the <strong>Moksha Theme</strong>. For information on how to control the look of <strong>GTK/QT</strong> applications please see the section <a href="other_settings.html">Other Settings</a>.
