        <h1>Bodhi Guide to Moksha - Compositing</h1>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Compositing</strong> is a feature which adds extra “eye-candy” for your
            desktop. There are 2 methods to achieve <strong>Compositing</strong> in the <strong>Bodhi
              Linux Moksha</strong> window manager.
            This article will explain what <strong>Compositing</strong> is and does, and describe the two methods for
            utilizing it in <strong>Moksha</strong>.  </p>
        <h3><a name="what_is_compositing"></a>
          What is Compositing?</h3>
        <p>It may be useful
            to start with the definition of the root word “composite” from <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/composite"
              target="_blank">The Free Dictionary</a> online:  </p>
        <pre>Made up of distinct components; compound.</pre>
        <p> This applies to
            a window manager in the sense that disparate visual elements can be
            combined to create a variety of visual effects. These include (but
            are not limited to): transparency, 3D effects, bending, scaling, and
            rotation.  </p>
        <p>There is a
            thorough article of the history and implementation of <strong>Compositing</strong>
            on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"
              target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for readers who are interested. 
        </p>

          Compositing</h3>
        <p>There is a <strong>Moksha</strong> <a href="modules.html">Module</a>
            for <strong>Compositing</strong> that is NOT installed by default in <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>.
            It is called <strong>moksha-module-comptonmod</strong>, and uses picom. You can install
            moksha-module-comptonmod from the <a href="https://www.bodhilinux.com/a/"
              target="_blank">appcentre</a>, or in a terminal.  </p>
        <pre>sudo apt install moksha-module-comptonmod</pre>
        <p> To enable the
            module, simply go to <em>Main Menu →
              Settings → Modules</em> and you will
            find it under the <em>Look</em> tab.  </p>
        <p>This <strong>Compositing</strong>
            does two primary things. The first is to allow transparent/opaque
            window effects. In general this will be applied to
            inactive/non-focused windows. In the screenshot below you can see
            that Thunar File Manager is not the focused window and the desktop
            background can be partially seen through it (Bodhi logo).  </p>
        <p>Also, <u>some</u>
            applications (terminal apps notably, but not all of them) also
            support transparency while active/focused. The screenshot also shows
            LXTerminal running and focused but you are still able to see the
            Midori window behind it and the desktop. The “depth” of the
            transparency in such a application will be set in that application's
            preferences (location of which will vary by application) and <strong>not</strong> in some
            general <strong>Compositing</strong> setting.  </p>
        <p>Note that in <u>some</u> <strong>Themes</strong> a <strong>Composite</strong>
            setting will need to be switched to active transparency. Go to <em>Main Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; All -&gt; Look
              -&gt; Composite</em>. In the lower
            part of the window, with the <em>Default</em> tab activated, switch to the "Still" setting, click
          <em>Apply</em>
            then <em>OK</em>
           </p>
        <p>The other effect,
            which can't be captured in a screenshot, is causing windows to be
            “bouncy” when switching. This gives a nice visual cue about which
            window you have switched to when multiple windows are open. 
        </p>
        <h3> Getting Rid of "Bouncy" Windows</h3>
        <p>Many users like
            the general effects of Compositing while at the same time disliking
            the “bouncy” effect that occurs when switching windows.  </p>
        <p>To disable this
            effect, go to <i>Main Menu → Settings → Settings Panel&nbsp; → Look
              → Compositing</i>.  </p>
        <p align="center"><br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>In the lower part
            of the window, select anything OTHER than <em>default</em>, click <em>Apply</em> and you will no longer have “bouncy” windows.
