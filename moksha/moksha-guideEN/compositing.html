<hr>


<p>

<strong>Compositing</strong> is a feature which adds extra “eye-candy” for your desktop. There are 2 methods to achieve  <strong>Compositing</strong> in the <strong>Bodhi Linux Moksha</strong> window manager. This article will explain what <strong>Compositing</strong> is and does, and describe the two methods for utilizing it in <strong>Moksha</strong>. 



</p>


<h3 id="what_is_compositing">What is Compositing?</h3>


<p>

It may be useful to start with the definition of the root word “composite” from <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/composite" class="urlextern" target="_blank" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/composite" rel="nofollow"> The Free Dictionary</a> online:
</p>
<pre class="code">Made up of distinct components; compound.</pre>

<p>
This applies to a window manager in the sense that disparate visual elements can be combined to create a variety of visual effects. These include (but are not limited to): transparency, 3D effects, bending, scaling, and rotation. 
</p>

<p>
There is a thorough article of the history and implementation of <strong>Compositing</strong> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager" target="_blank" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager" rel="nofollow"> Wikipedia</a> for readers who are interested. 
</p>


<h3 id="default_compositing">Compositing</h3>


<p>
There is a <strong>Moksha</strong> <a href="modules.html">Module</a> for <strong>Compositing</strong> that is NOT installed by default in <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong>. It is called <strong>moksha-module-comptonmod</strong>, and uses picom. You can install moksha-module-comptonmod from the <a href="https://www.bodhilinux.com/a/" target="_blank" title="https://www.bodhilinux.com/a/" rel="nofollow"> appcentre</a>, or in a terminal. <pre class="code">sudo apt install moksha-module-comptonmod</pre> To enable the module, simply go to <em>Main Menu → Settings → Modules</em> and you will find it under the <em>Look</em> tab.



</p>

<p>
This <strong>Compositing</strong> does two primary things. The first is to allow transparent/opaque window effects. In general this will be applied to inactive/non-focused windows. In the screenshot below you can see that Midori is not the focused window and the desktop background can be partially seen through it (the tree and the moon). 
</p>

<p>
Also, <u>some</u> applications (terminal apps notably, but not all of them) also support transparency while active/focused. The screenshot also shows LXTerminal running and focused but you are still able to see the Midori window behind it and the desktop. The “depth” of the transparency in such a application will be set in that application&#039;s preferences (location of which will vary by application) and <strong>not</strong> in some general <strong>Compositing</strong> setting.

<p>Note that in <u>some</u> <strong>Themes</strong> a <strong>Composite</strong> setting will need to be switched to active transparency. Go to <em>Main Menu -> Settings -> All -> Look -> Composite</em>. In the lower part of the window, with the <em>Default</em> tab activated, switch to the "Still" setting, click <em>Apply</em> then <em>OK</em>

<p>
The other effect, which can&#039;t be captured in a screenshot, is causing windows to be “bouncy” when switching. This gives a nice visual cue about which window you have switched to when multiple windows are open. 
</p>

<h3>Getting Rid of "Bouncy" Windows</h3>
<p>
Many users like the general effects of Compositing while at the same time disliking the “bouncy” effect that occurs when switching windows.

<p>
To disable this effect, go to Main Menu → Settings → All → Look → Compositing.

<center><img src="../images/disable_bouncy.png"></center>

In the lower part of the window, select anything OTHER than <em>default</em>, click <em>Apply</em> and you will no longer have “bouncy” windows.
