        <h1> The Bodhi Guide to Moksha<br />
          Profiles</h1>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Profiles</strong> are a powerful tool. They control the
          layout of your <strong>Moksha</strong> desktop. But you must be
          careful not to confuse <strong>Profiles</strong> with <a href="themes.html">Themes</a>.
          <strong>Themes</strong> control the colors of your desktop and the
          appearance of your <a href="gadgets.html">Gadgets</a>. <strong>Profiles</strong>
          control where those <strong>Gadgets</strong> are positioned and what
          <strong>Theme</strong> you have selected. </p>
        <p><strong>Profiles</strong> are useful because they make it easy to
          swap quickly between two entirely different layouts. This is
          especially useful for changing between a single- and a dual-monitor
          layout, or when you have two people using a computer with the same
          login, but with different desktop preferences.
        </p>
        <h2> Bodhi Linux's Default Profiles </h2>
        <p><strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> ships with just the one <strong>Profile</strong>
          called <strong>default. </strong>When you change your set up, the
          changes get saved as <strong>Bodhi Profile. </strong>To revert any
          changes that you make you can either <strong>scratch</strong> the
          profile in the profile settings window, or select the <strong>default</strong>
          profile.</p>
        <br />
        <h2> Saving a Personalized Profile </h2>
        <p>Suppose that you have started with <strong>Bodhi Linux's</strong>
          default <strong>Profile</strong> and have modified it by adding few <strong>Gadgets</strong>
          and changing the <strong>Theme</strong>. You really like the setup
          you now have, but want to try a different set up<strong></strong>,
          it's easy to save the profile. Open the <strong>Profile Selector</strong>
          under <em>Main Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Settings Panel -&gt;
            Settings tab -&gt; Profiles</em>. Click the <em>Add</em> button and
          a pop-up window will ask you for the name you want to use. </p>
        <p>You can then switch to another <strong>Profile</strong> if you like,
          make modifications to that one and save it as yet another personal <strong>Profile</strong>.
          You can modify and save as many personal <strong>Profiles</strong> as
          you like.
