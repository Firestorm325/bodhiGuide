        <h1> The Bodhi Guide to Moksha Introduction</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>This <em>Bodhi Guide to Moksha</em> is intended to be your complete
          resource for using Bodhi Linux with the <strong><a href="https://www.bodhilinux.com/moksha-desktop/%22">Moksha
              Window Manager</a></strong>. This guide is intended for <em>
            everyone </em>, from new Bodhi Linux users to those who hope to
          join the Bodhi Linux team. </p>
        <h2>What is Bodhi Linux</h2>
        Bodhi Linux, in short, is <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu LTS</a>
        (currently 20.04) using Moksha Window Manager, a fork of the <a href="https://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment
          E17</a>. Bodhi was originally developed by, <a href="https://www.jeffhoogland.com">Jeff
          Hoogland</a>, but is now headed by lead developer Robert (Ylee) Wiley,
        with developer and Moksha guru Stefan (The Waiter) Umram and long time
        team member and dedicated Sys Admin Tristam. The team is growing as is
        the wider community with recently established Web-Dev Team headed by
        Eran Gelo and Codernic, and with a newly re-established responsive and
        welcoming forum and discord channel. The Bodhi community is known for
        being friendly and welcoming and as a result continues to grow!<br />

        <h3>What is a Window Manager</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">Wikipedia</a>,
          “[a] window manager is system software that controls the placement and
          appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user
          interface … They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical
          system which provides required functionality such as support for
          graphics hardware, pointing devices, and a keyboard, and are often
          written and created using a widget toolkit.”</p>
        In non-technical terms, the Window Manager is essentially what the end
        user sees and interacts with, the "GUI" (graphical user interface). Over
        time, many Window Managers have been extended to become full-fledged
        Desktop Environments. A Desktop Environment is generally considered to
        be a Window Manager that integrates common applications and services
        along with the Window Manager.
        <p>One exciting part about Linux, and one of the ways it stands out from
          other operating systems such as Windows and OSX, is that the end user
          has a plethora of choices for how they can interact with their
          computer. This is partly, and perhaps most obviously, done through
          providing various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers">Window
            Managers and Desktop Environments for users to choose from</a><a>. </a></p>
        <p><a> By default, Ubuntu Linux uses </a><a href="https://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a>.
          Although great in many ways, Gnome is not known for being extremely
          fast, nor is it suited for older machines as it is large and consists
          of many applications, each with their own long list of dependencies.
          The current LTS release of Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">recommends</a>
          4 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free hard drive space. With this large
          footprint, Ubuntu provides out-of-the-box support for most systems
          including for most graphics cards, sound cards, and even touch
          screens, but also brings many additional applications that may be used
          by some users while never used by others. </p>
        <p> <strong>The goal of Bodhi Linux was and continues to be to bring
            combine the best parts of Ubuntu with the more streamlined,
            flexible, fast, and less resource-hungry Window Manager known as
            "Moksha".</strong> In other words, to bring an elegant Linux
          distribution at a fraction of the resource use of most other
          distributions while sacrificing none of the beauty or core
          functionality of Ubuntu. </p>
        <h3>What is Moksha Window Manager</h3>
        Moksha Window Manager is a fork of Enlightenment version 0.1.7 ("E17").
        <p> Bodhi Linux was originally built using the <strong>Enlightenment
            Window Manager</strong>. Although known as a Window Manager,
          Enlightenment stradles the line between a Window Manager and a Desktop
          Environment by bringing most of the functionality found in much more
          resource-hungry Desktop Environments. </p>
        <p>The first version of <strong>Enlightenment</strong> was released in
          1997. In December 2000 it was completely re-written using the <strong>Enlightenment
            Foundation Libraries (EFL)</strong>, and remains in active
          development to this day. For years, E17 was used as the Window Manager
          of Bodhi Linux. In 2015, founder and lead developer Jeff Hoogland,
          began a fork of the E17 Window Manager. This fork, specifically
          designed for Bodhi Linux, became known as "Moksha" (pronounced
          “mohk-shuh”). <strong>Moksha is Sanskrit in origin just like Bodhi.
            It means “emancipation, liberation, or release”</strong> </p>
        <p> A full telling of why Moksha Window Manager was developed can be
          found here: <a href="http://www.bodhilinux.com/2015/04/28/introducing-the-moksha-desktop/">Introducing
            the Moksha Window Manager</a>. </p>
        <h2>Enlightenment, Moksha, and Bodhi Linux</h2>
        <p><strong>E17</strong> was the natural choice as a Window Manager in <strong>Bodhi
            Linux</strong>, as it fit in perfectly with two of the most
          important <strong>Bodhi Linux</strong> ideals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Minimalism</strong> - A default install of Enlightenment
            will run on less than 100 MB of RAM. That is <strong><u>far</u></strong>
            less than most modern Window Managers, not to mention complete
            Desktop Environments. But it doesn't come at the expense of great
            looks or functionality. Enlightenment is one of the most elegant
            Window Managers available, and is highly extensible through the use
            of <a href="modules.html">Modules</a>. </li>
          <li> <strong>User Choice:</strong> Enlightenment is probably the most
            highly configurable Window Manager in existence, so you can make <em>your</em>
            system look and work the way <em>you</em> want. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Moksha Window Manager was born with these same ideals in mind,
          taking the best parts of what E17 brought to the table, while fixing,
          modifying, and expanding on what did not quite fit right with the
          project. The Moksha development team upstreams patches where
          appropriate and will always be greatful for the fact that without E17
          and its developers, Bodhi Linux and the Moksha Window Manager would
          never have been possible. </p>
